# RankCheck

Automatic leaderboard lookup tool for Awesomenauts.

**[Download the latest release here!](https://github.com/Marukyu/RankCheck/releases/)**

RankCheck can be run alongside Awesomenauts and detects when a match begins. Leaderboard information for all players in
the match is automatically requested from a web server and displayed in the RankCheck window. It replaces the process
of manually looking up players on external leaderboard websites. It also allows streamers to overlay player information
on their Awesomenauts streams.

## Features

* Automatic detection of online, custom and bot matches
* Leaderboard lookup (database is refreshed every 30 minutes)
* Nickname tracker (shows each player's most commonly used name below their current name, if they differ)
* Encounter counter (tracks how often a player was encountered on the same or opposing team)
* Rating gain/loss history tracker
* Country lookup
* Streamer friendly (can be used as a color-keyed overlay, player info can be set to disappear after some time)
* Player card layout is completely customizable using a live-reloaded config file

### Building from source

Clone this repository using Git and use [CMake](https://cmake.org) to build RankCheck from source.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Marukyu/RankCheck.git
cd RankCheck
git pull --recurse-submodules
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

Library and header files for [SFML 2.3 or newer](https://sfml-dev.org) and [Poco Foundation 1.9 or
newer](https://pocoproject.org/), as well as their respective dependencies, must be installed.

A C++11 compliant compiler such as GCC 5 or newer is required to build RankCheck. Visual Studio has not been tested.

A copy of [`rankcheck.dat`](https://rankcheck.marukyu.de/files/rankcheck.dat) is required for RankCheck to run. The
file must be placed in the RankCheck working directory. For license reasons, this file or its contents are not included
